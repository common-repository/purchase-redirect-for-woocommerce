== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Q: How do I change the redirect link?

A: You can change the redirect link by going to the "Purchase Redirect for WooCommerce" settings page in the WordPress admin panel and updating the "Redirect Link" field.

Q: What are temporary links, and how do they work?

A: Temporary links are generated for users who make a purchase. They expire after a set period of time. You can enable or disable temporary links in the plugin settings.

Q: What happens to temporary links if my website redirects all 404 errors?

A: If 404 redirection is enabled and configured to automatically redirect all 404 errors (missing pages) to a predefined page (such as the homepage or a specific landing page), these temporary links might be treated as invalid.

Q: How can I make sure my temporary page works properly?

A: You can either exclude the temporary page from 404 redirection or turn off any 404 redirection plugins.

Q: What happens to temporary links if my website has caching enabled?  

A: If caching is enabled, temporary links may not work properly because the cached version of the page could show outdated information or redirect users to a different page, making the temporary link seem invalid.

Q: How can I make sure my temporary page works properly with caching enabled?  

A: You can exclude the temporary page from being cached. Suppose your domain.com/sales-page/temporary-link, so exclude all from domain.com/sales-page/
	Check your cache plugins for further details.
